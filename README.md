Weâ€™re revolutionising how businesses handle communication by replacing entire customer service departments with a single copilot box.

We are developing what we call a mini-AGI system - autonomous AI agents that work together like human team. 

It's as simple as typing: "send message to all the people who have sent dm regarding the job opening for SDE. Yes, we have one available. Please send your CV." - and watching our AI spring into action.
